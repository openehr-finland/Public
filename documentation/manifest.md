# OpenEHR Finland's Manifest (STABLE)

The storage of customer and patient data in uniform and precise data models enables the use of data in a cost-effective manner while preserving the quality of the data. A precise data model refers to a level in social welfare and health care, which enables the field of information processing needs and takes into account the ways and situations in which information should be stored.

openEHR is an international, open specification for storing, retrieving, managing and sharing social and healthcare data. openEHR specifications are available to everyone without a separate fee. Specific specifications are used to structure data models (archetypes and templates) and applications. OpenEHR specifications also lay the foundation for support of social and health care processes across organizational boundaries.

OpenEHR International is voluntary and is an international network. Its members include social and health care experts, IT companies, researchers and modeling experts. The international data model library in the Community, in particular with regard to healthcare, includes a comprehensive set of data models approved by the Community. The coverage of social care archetypes is improving all the time. National libraries complement the international library for country-specific localisations.

openEHR Finland is a sub-group of Hl7 Finland and its main objectives and principles are as follows:

## Semantic interoperability

A common open data model library for the use of health and social services actors, authorities and system providers, the archetypes of which are based on both software development and nationally defined data content.
Promote the sharing of openEHR data models with HL7 FHIR resources and OMOP data models.

## Making use of cooperation

The localisation of international archetypes is carried out in order and scope provided by system suppliers and will be made available to all. Localisation refers to the translation of archetypes into Finnish, tying data elements to national codes, and agreement on extensions in cases where no corresponding data element can be found in international archetypes.

## Access to information

openEHR Finland promotes the creation and networking of openEHR-based data warehouses.
openEHR-based data storage and joint extens agreement allow for content searches from openEHR data warehouses. Content searches can be standardized and reused or modified easily for different purposes. openEHR Finland aims to promote the use of content searches in both operational operations and in secondary use of information.

## Increasing knowledge and competence

openEHR Finland is growing knowledge and expertise related to the Finnish social and healthcare openEHR approach by training and promoting cooperation with other Nordic countries. openEHR Finland also aims to participate in openEHR International activities.
